Data Viz with Tableau Public

You can create stunning data visualizations from across the web created with Tableau Public. In this repository I will use data from web resources and create public data viz samples. 


I have used sample superstore sale data to create a viz for average sale by US cities.
Here is the link for it.

Also a very basic dashboard for showing sale amounts on the map, compairing discount and sale per region, and profit for segments per reigon.
