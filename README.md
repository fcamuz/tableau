Data Viz with Tableau Public

You can create stunning data visualizations from across the web created with Tableau Public. In this repository I will use data from web resources and create public data viz samples. 


I have used sample superstore sale data to create dashboard for showing sale amounts on the map, compairing discount and sale per region, sale and profit per region, and profit for segments per reigon. 

Filters can be applied to all visualizations on the dashboard. It is an interactive and animated dashboard.
